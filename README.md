Hello! This is my secound desgin. 
- Kasper desgin PSD - has been taken from https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-psd-template which was for free .. 
  Font-family: 'Open Sans'

I changed the PSD to code via HTML and CSS, I liked what I did becuase I've used a new featuers and ideas for me in my version such as :

- "The header on the fly" which means I made the header without any background.

-  Fully responsive hidden navigation of the header on smallest screens, Also I used the "box-shadow" on hidden nav with its prefixes.

-  caret-color.

-  On landing I've changed the basic background into a loopy Video mixed with header.

-  On Landing-vid and all other vids I've user a layer of layout to fix the color.

- on Portfolio section I've used grid system with hidden section above the picturs.

-  I used inline style in HTML for Skills section.

-  Pricing section was fully new to me, Same as Skills section.

-  New selectors in CSS has be used successfully.  

Next update:
1. using JS to scroll in Landing, Portfolio, Testomonials sections
